# Packer Ansible

Builds a container image that can then be used to build Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) via [Hashicorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon.html) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

# Tagging

It is often best to tag the resultant image with the same version as the Packer version being used (e.g., packer-ansible:1.7.10).
